            <p>
                Welcome to the message site! So before you start reading, let me introduce this site. Firstly, I think
                it is important to first let you know why I decided to make this site. I eventually decided to move this
                part to the <i>motivation</i> section below. Mainly, this site contains things that I want to talk about
                to you and Beaktin (Beaktin has his own individual page of message, that's why I implemented a login
                system), but couldn't find a way to properly start a conversation that you can also engage in without it
                becoming just me talking and rant about life. So, again, be reminded not to share this text to anyone
                else, as this is just me trying to express my life thoughts to someone.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                This section is dedecated to explain <i>why</i> I decided to set up this site when clearly I have to
                spent a great amount of time typing and processing my thoughts (actually I don't, so apologise if my
                text here are non-sense or self-contradictory, I am writing this as I think and I have no organisation
                at all). If you still remember, which I think you do as you remember even the exsistence of this site
                unlike me, on 4th of January, I made a secret text in a meme (I miss the times when secret texts was
                still a thing in calculus class, or should I say, I miss the times when conversations was still a thing
                in calculus class) to tell you to visit this site on the 3rd of February. The reason is that I was
                facing a hard time back then, having to deal with my terrible exam grades in the first few days of the
                exam, which were all the subjects I am weak at, and my future as my A-Level exam is approching, and
                applying to universities, etc. Also, I was, and am, very hurt about how you and Beaktin hid meme ideas
                from me by deleting messages on 31st December. Although of course I was still able to read then from 
                the notifications, I was deeply hurt as I never thought that you two would want to make my meme-making
                production harder than Beaktin when he sees Macy, since afterall I gain nothing from making memes, and
                you two are the only ones that benefit from my memes. Thus, I made the decision to make a website to
                honestly tell you my feelings, and kind of use you as a tree-hole and tell you my feelings on 3rd 
                February. Eventually gradually overtime, we had a lot of fun throughout January, and my A-Level exam
                result turned out to be not <i>so</i> bad, and on the day I crashed my future we had a great
                conversation in calculus class, and all of these events had made me very happy about my life then,
                and I forgot about this whole github message thingy. Then on the day you are supposed to receive my
                message, I still haven't recalled this deep memory about this site, and I didn't understand you at
                first, and only recalled it the next day. At that time, I was very positive and didn't need much
                help, so I decided to host the site again a month later, only this time I won't use it as a tree-hole:
                I will use it as a hole (jk). Slowly over February, as I don't have to compulsory meme duty anymore, the
                number of messages in calculus class began to decrease. In addition to the holiday and therefore a
                decrease in number of things to talk about, I was not so happy that I was just lonelily sitting at home
                doing nothing but thinking of ways to start a conversation. Eventally, Beaktin complained about me being
                annoying when starting conversations on a Saturday, and the number of messages go not stonks after I don't
                start conversations anymore. See the <i>About Conversations</i> section below for more. I hope you
                understand my feelings, and if you will, spend time reading this rather long text.
